# Sample Document Title

This is a sample markdown document that represents typical output from the PDF processor.

## Section 1: Introduction

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. This paragraph demonstrates standard text extraction capabilities. The processor should maintain paragraph structure and proper spacing.

### Subsection 1.1

Here is some content with **bold text** and *italic text* mixed together. The emphasis markers should be balanced.

## Section 2: Tables

The following table shows financial data:

| Year | Revenue | Profit | Growth |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2020 | $1.2M   | $200K  | 12%    |
| 2021 | $1.5M   | $350K  | 25%    |
| 2022 | $2.0M   | $500K  | 33%    |

### Another Table Example

| Name | Age | City |
|------|-----|------|

  - Nested item 2
- Fourth item

### Numbered List

1. Step one of the process
2. Step two continues
3. Step three finalizes

## Section 4: Mathematical Content

The famous equation $E = mc^2$ describes mass-energy equivalence.

For more complex expressions:

$$
\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx = F(1) - F(0)
$$

Greek letters like $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are commonly used in mathematics.

## Section 5: Code

Here is an example code block:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True
```

## Conclusion

This sample document demonstrates the various elements that can be extracted from PDFs and converted to well-formatted markdown.
